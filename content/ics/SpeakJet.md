## Manufacturer Description

The SpeakJet is a completely self contained, single chip voice and complex sound synthesizer. It uses Mathematical Sound Architecture (MSA) technology which controls an internal five channel sound synthesizer to generate on-the-fly, unlimited vocabulary speech synthesis and complex sounds. The SpeakJet is preconfigured with 72 speech elements (allophones), 43 sound effects, and 12 DTMF Touch Tones. Through the selection of these MSA components and in combination with the control of the pitch, rate, bend, and volume parameters, the user has the ability to produce unlimited phrases and sound effects, with thousands of variations, at any time. This is not recorded waveforms or sound fragments but truly synthetic sound.

The SpeakJet can be controlled simultaneously by logic changes on any one of its eight Event Input lines, and/or by a Serial Data line from a CPU (such as the OOPic, Basic Stamp or PC) allowing for both CPU Controlled and Stand-Alone operations.

Other features include an internal 64 byte input buffer, Internal Programmable EEPROM, three programmable outputs, and direct user access to the internal five channel sound synthesizer

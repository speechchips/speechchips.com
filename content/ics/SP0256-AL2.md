The SP0256-AL2, also known as the "SPO256 Narrator Speech Processor", produces all 59 phonemes of the English language plus 5 pauses of different durations. It's part of the general "SP0" family and has many variants.  Each of the phoneme's speech patterns are individually addressable, making the SP0256-AL2 capable of saying anything that can be said in the English language. This is the simplest approach to universal speech synthesis and the speech quality is highly intelligible.

## Manufacturer Description

The SPO256 (Speech Processor) is a single chip N-Channel MOS LSI device that is able, using its stored program, to synthesize speech or complex sounds.

The achievable output is equivalent to a flat frequency response ranging from 0 to 5 kHz, a dynamic range of 42dB, and a signal to noise ratio of approximately 35dB.

The SP0256 incorporates four basic functions:
* A software programable digital filter that can be made to model a vocal tract.
* A 16K ROM which stores both data and instructions.
* A Microcontroller which controls the data flow from the ROM to the digital filter, the assembly of the “word strings” necessary for linking speech elements together, and the amplitude and pitch information to excite the digital filter.
* A Puls Width Modulator that creates A digital output which is converted to an analog signal when filtered by an external low pass filter.

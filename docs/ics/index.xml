      <description>SP0256-AL2 #    The SP0256-AL2, also known as the &amp;ldquo;SPO256 Narrator Speech Processor&amp;rdquo;, produces all 59 phonemes of the English language plus 5 pauses of different durations. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the general &amp;ldquo;SP0&amp;rdquo; family and has many variants. Each of the phoneme&amp;rsquo;s speech patterns are individually addressable, making the SP0256-AL2 capable of saying anything that can be said in the English language. This is the simplest approach to universal speech synthesis and the speech quality is highly intelligible.</description>

# Votrax SC-01A

The SC-01 Speech Synthesizer is a completely self-contained solid state device.  This single chip phonetically synthesizes continuous speech, of unlimited vocabulary, form low data rate inputs. 

Speech is synthesized by combining phonemes (the building blocks of speech) in the appropriate sequence. The SC-01 Speech Synthesizer contains 64 different phonemes which are accessed by a 6-bit code.  It is the proper sequential combination of these phoneme codes that create continuous speech.

Signals from the SC-01 are applied to an audio output device to amplify and distribute the synthesized speech.

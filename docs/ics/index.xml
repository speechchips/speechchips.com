      <description>General Instruments SP0256-AL2 #  The SP0256-AL2 produces all 59 phonemes of the English language plus 5 pauses of different durations. Each of the phoneme&amp;rsquo;s speech patterns are individually addressable, making the SP0256-AL2 capable of saying anything that can be said in the English language. This is the simplest approach to universal speech synthesis and the speech quality makes for a good robot voice.</description>

      <description>Votrax SC-01A #  The SC-01 Speech Synthesizer is a completely self-contained solid state device. This single chip phonetically synthesizes continuous speech, of unlimited vocabulary, form low data rate inputs.
Speech is synthesized by combining phonemes (the building blocks of speech) in the appropriate sequence. The SC-01 Speech Synthesizer contains 64 different phonemes which are accessed by a 6-bit code. It is the proper sequential combination of these phoneme codes that create continuous speech.</description>

  About Us

</h1>
<p>It all started with the 
  <a href="../ics/SP0256-AL2/">SPO256-AL2</a>&hellip; This website was founded and created by Kenneth Lemieux in 2003 in a quest to make his robot talk. He then focused solely on these 1980&rsquo;s vintage speech chips and built this site to source and help others buy these hard-to-find speech chips. In 2012, Ken went on to create his own low-power text-to-speech IC known as the SP0-512 RoboVoice and was featured in 
  <a href="http://servo.texterity.com/servo/201211/?folio=44&amp;pg=44#pg44">SERVO Magazine</a> and 
  <a href="http://nutsvolts.texterity.com/nutsvolts/201210?pg=29#pg29">Nuts And Volts</a>. Ken moved on to other projects since, but speech chips will forever be part of his history.</p>
<p>In 2020, Joseph Hsieh acquired a pair of Heathkit HERO robots on Craigslist from a retired engineer and wanted to keep himself busy during the COVID-19 pandemic to restore his robots and to learn more about DIY electronics. He discovered the Votrax 
  <a href="../ics/SC-01A/">SC-01A</a> on the HERO 1 and wanted to learn more about how it works - soon after, he stumbled upon speechchips.com as it was frequently referenced in past forums and newsgroups as Ken was a vocal member of the electronic hobbyists community.  Speechchips.com hasn&rsquo;t been updated for some time&hellip;</p>
<p>Joe reached out to Ken, and after a few allophones and phonemes that were exchanged, they agreed to turn this site into a resource for all vintage speech chip seekers!</p>

<p>I wanted to build a robot. That&rsquo;s how this whole thing started. I just needed controller, an H-bridge, some motors and some sensors. Oh yea, it also has to talk.</p>
<p>OK, so I have trouble focusing. What started out 20 years ago as a search for SP0256-AL2 speech synthsizer IC&rsquo;s is now an online business specializing in speech related projects for embedded hobbyists.</p>

<p>It started with getting a Heathkit HERO robot, and trying to make it talk. Specifically, I wanted to know how the Votrax <a href="../ics/SC-01A">SC-01A</a> works. After being fascinated with it&rsquo;s history, I found this site and reached out to Ken because I was looking for details on that chip&hellip;</p>
<p>So, now I&rsquo;m trying to preserve everything I&rsquo;m learning about speech chips on this site to hopefully keep them talking for decades to come!</p>

  <p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m posting this as the first &ldquo;Update Post&rdquo; to this site to start things off.  After talking to Ken Lemieux, who was the original creator of speechchips.com, I convinced him to turn speechchips.com into a resource for this small but vocal niche. My goal is to put everything I find in one place as many of my findings were strewn across the internet in old forum posts, blogs, archived newsgroups, and even historical snapshots of websites from archive.org. I&rsquo;ll cite all references whenever possible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated with speech synthesis and wondered how computers or electronic devices talk. Like many, I too had a Speak &amp; Spell in the mid 80&rsquo;s as a kid and only now realize its amongst the first consumer devices to have a speech synthesis integrated chip (Texas Instrument&rsquo;s TMS5100) to make it speak. In the golden 80&rsquo;s to even early or mid 90&rsquo;s era, many manufacturers developed their own synthesized chip for talking devices, computers, and even robots.</p>
<p>In fact, it was the Heathkit HERO 1 Robot that led me to rediscover this fascinating development of speech synthesis with it&rsquo;s onboard speech synthesis chip, the venerable Votrax SC-01. Although modern day speech synthesis, most often from voice assistants, are done by CPUs or DSPs or sometimes streamed directly from the cloud, I hope this site will let us explore the various chips, boards, and devices that started it all.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been assembling all the research I have found available relating to speech chips and speech synthesis in general and hope to compile it on this site and in the file section of (groups.io/g/speechchips)[https://groups.io/g/speechchips] to share. I&rsquo;m using groups.io to archive the files as it&rsquo;s a more practical way to organize files and folders with its generous storage size.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for datasheets, or other ephermas that I&rsquo;ve collected along the way, please go to the &ldquo;Files&rdquo; section here:
<a href="https://groups.io/g/speechchips/files">https://groups.io/g/speechchips/files</a></p>
<p>The companion &ldquo;mailing list&rdquo; to this site is here:
<a href="https://groups.io/g/speechchips">https://groups.io/g/speechchips</a></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something specific, feel free to make a post in groups.io and if I&rsquo;m not able to help, I&rsquo;m sure somebody on the internet will come to the rescue in time.</p>
<p>Godspeed!</p>

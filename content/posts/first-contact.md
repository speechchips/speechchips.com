Hello,

I'm posting this as the first "Update Post" to this site to start things off.  After talking to Ken Lemieux, who was the original creator of speechchips.com, I convinced him to turn speechchips.com into a resource for this small but vocal niche. My goal is to put everything I find in one place as many of my findings were strewn across the internet in old forum posts, blogs, archived newsgroups, and even historical snapshots of websites from archive.org. I'll cite all references whenever possible. 
 
I've always been fascinated with speech synthesis and wondered how computers or electronic devices talk. Like many, I too had a Speak & Spell in the mid 80's as a kid and only now realize its amongst the first consumer devices to have a speech synthesis integrated chip (Texas Instrument's TMS5100) to make it speak. In the golden 80's to even early or mid 90's era, many manufacturers developed their own synthesized chip for talking devices, computers, and even robots.

In fact, it was the Heathkit HERO 1 Robot that led me to rediscover this fascinating development of speech synthesis with it's onboard speech synthesis chip, the venerable Votrax SC-01. Although modern day speech synthesis, most often from voice assistants, are done by CPUs or DSPs or sometimes streamed directly from the cloud, I hope this site will let us explore the various chips, boards, and devices that started it all.

In the last few weeks, I've been assembling all the research I have found available relating to speech chips and speech synthesis in general and hope to compile it on this site and in the file section of (groups.io/g/speechchips)[https://groups.io/g/speechchips] to share. I'm using groups.io to archive the files as it's a more practical way to organize files and folders with its generous storage size. 

If you're looking for datasheets, or other ephermas that I've collected along the way, please go to the "Files" section here:
https://groups.io/g/speechchips/files

The companion "mailing list" to this site is here:
https://groups.io/g/speechchips

If you're looking for something specific, feel free to make a post in groups.io and if I'm not able to help, I'm sure somebody on the internet will come to the rescue in time.

Godspeed!

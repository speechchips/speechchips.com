# General Instruments SP0256-AL2

The SP0256-AL2 produces all 59 phonemes of the English language plus 5 pauses of different durations. Each of the phoneme's speech patterns are individually addressable, making the SP0256-AL2 capable of saying anything that can be said in the English language. This is the simplest approach to universal speech synthesis and the speech quality makes for a good robot voice.

      <description>Hello,
I&amp;rsquo;m posting this as the first &amp;ldquo;Update Post&amp;rdquo; to this site to start things off.

My goal is to put everything I find in one place as many of my findings were strewn across the internet in old forum posts, blogs, archived newsgroups, and even historical snapshots of websites from archive.</description>

# About Us

It all started with the [SPO256-AL2](/ics/SP0256-AL2)... This website was founded and created by Kenneth Lemieux in 2003 in a quest to make his robot talk. He then focused solely on these 1980's vintage speech chips and built this site to source and help others buy these hard-to-find speech chips. In 2012, Ken went on to create his own low-power text-to-speech IC known as the SP0-512 RoboVoice and was featured in [SERVO Magazine](http://servo.texterity.com/servo/201211/?folio=44&pg=44#pg44) and [Nuts And Volts](http://nutsvolts.texterity.com/nutsvolts/201210?pg=29#pg29). Ken moved on to other projects since, but speech chips will forever be part of his history.

In 2020, Joseph Hsieh acquired a pair of Heathkit HERO robots on Craigslist from a retired engineer and wanted to keep himself busy during the COVID-19 pandemic to restore his robots and to learn more about DIY electronics. He discovered the Votrax [SC-01A](/ics/SC-01A) on the HERO 1 and wanted to learn more about how it works - soon after, he stumbled upon speechchips.com as it was frequently referenced in past forums and newsgroups as Ken was a vocal member of the electronic hobbyists community.  Speechchips.com hasn't been updated for some time...

Joe reached out to Ken, and after a few allophones and phonemes that were exchanged, they agreed to turn this site into a resource for all vintage speech chip seekers!

I wanted to build a robot. That's how this whole thing started. I just needed controller, an H-bridge, some motors and some sensors. Oh yea, it also has to talk.

OK, so I have trouble focusing. What started out 20 years ago as a search for SP0256-AL2 speech synthsizer IC's is now an online business specializing in speech related projects for embedded hobbyists.

It started with getting a Heathkit HERO robot, and trying to make it talk. Specifically, I wanted to know how the Votrax [SC-01A](/ics/SC-01A) works. After being fascinated with it's history, I found this site and reached out to Ken because I was looking for details on that chip...  

So, now I'm trying to preserve everything I'm learning about speech chips on this site to hopefully keep them talking for decades to come!
